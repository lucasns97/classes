# Octave Class

## author: Lucas Nunes Sequeira, Brazil

### date: April 7, 2019

In this class, I introduced Octave as a help for my classmates. That semester we had numeric comptation, and we all mostly knew **C**, but knowing a high lavel language would make thing much easier, thats the motivation to learn **Octave**.

During the class, we've solved the SIR model in **Octave**. Mathematical epidemiology model propose by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927, which describes the dinâmic of a population divided into three classes:
  1. S - Susceptible
  2. I - Infected
  3. R - Recovered
The model presumes the ordinary differential equation (ODE) below, and more about it can be accessed on: "Modelos matemáticos de equações diferenciais ordinárias aplicados àepidemiologia", BARROS, A. M. R., UFLA/MG.

$$begin{cases}
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta SI\\
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI -\gamma I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I
end{cases}$$
